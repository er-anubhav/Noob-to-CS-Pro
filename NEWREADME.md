# Summary

Welcome to my personal journey through the OSSU curriculum! Yes, I know, I call myself a "full-stack noob," but I'm also on a quest to turn that around! The OSSU curriculum offers a **complete education in computer science** using online resources from top universities, including Harvard, Princeton, and MIT. It‚Äôs like getting a world-class degree without selling my kidney to pay for it. üéìüõ°Ô∏è

This curriculum isn't just for folks looking to boost their careers (although it totally works for that too). It‚Äôs for anyone like me, who wants a deep, *well-rounded* understanding of the core principles of computer science. It‚Äôs not just about coding; it‚Äôs about grasping the ideas that underpin all computing disciplines. And guess what? I‚Äôll be doing this largely on my own, armed with a little discipline, a lot of coffee, and the support of a global community of fellow learners.

The curriculum is modeled after a traditional undergrad CS degree, minus the general ed stuff (because who really misses writing essays on 18th-century poetry?). It‚Äôs split into several stages:

- **Intro CS:** The "dip-your-toes-in" phase where I test the waters of Computer Science.
- **Core CS:** This is where I‚Äôll tackle the essential CS courses, basically mirroring the first three years of a CS major.
- **Advanced CS:** The final year‚Äôs worth of electives where I‚Äôll dive deep into the areas that intrigue me most (Hello, Machine Learning!).
- **Final Project:** The grand finale where I‚Äôll consolidate all my new-found knowledge into a project that (hopefully) screams, "Look, Ma, I‚Äôm not a noob anymore!"

**Duration**: If I play my cards right and devote good hours a week, I should be able to wrap this up in about 1 years. Sounds doable (Fingers crossed!)

I‚Äôll be tracking my progress with [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12IMv7XXKIItnRFtiItnQgs2GtgKJaKNOTcVp-h6K5sI/edit?usp=sharing). Feel free to check in on my progress.

**Cost**: Free. (I have Budget Issues! HAHAhaha (Sad Emoji)

**Process**: I‚Äôll mostly stick to the order of courses suggested. It‚Äôs like following a recipe ‚Äì except I‚Äôm making a Computer Science cake. I might juggle a few courses in parallel just to keep things interesting.

Oh, and one last thing: If you catch me showing off my coursework publicly, rest assured, I'm only sharing what I'm allowed to. No shady business here, promise!

# Community

Being a lone wolf is cool and all, but it‚Äôs way more fun with a pack! The OSSU community is active on Discord, and I‚Äôm already there. Come say hi! üëã

- **[Join the OSSU Discord](https://discord.gg/wuytwK5s9h)**: This is where all the cool (and geeky) conversations happen.
- **GitHub Issues**: If you spot a glitch in the curriculum or have a better idea, GitHub is the place to discuss it..
- **LinkedIn**: Oh yeah, I‚Äôll be adding **Open Source Society University** to my LinkedIn profile, just to keep things official.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the Core CS courses, I need to brush up on some high school math, specifically algebra, geometry, and pre-calculus. Advanced CS assumes I‚Äôve completed Core CS and have a pretty solid understanding of the fundamentals. Oh, and I might need to recall some high school physics too (e.g., AP Physics) for Advanced systems.
